Hello! I’m Md. Ariful Islam, a graduate in Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering from the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).

My primary research interests lie in machine learning, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), heat transfer, renewable energy, and optimization. In my undergraduate thesis, which was funded by the Research and Innovation Center for Science and Technology (RISE), I focused on optimizing the placement of offshore wind turbines using machine learning techniques. Additionally, I have worked on data-driven ship design, automating the prediction of hydrostatic parameters using MATLAB and Maxsurf. Currently, I am working on simulating cross-fin heat sinks to optimize heat transfer efficiency using ANSYS Fluent.

I possess a solid foundation in thermal-fluid sciences and have hands-on expertise in tools such as ANSYS Fluent, Abaqus CAE, Maxsurf, AutoCAD, Rhinoceros, MATLAB, Python, C++, and Fortran.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am an avid enthusiast of cricket and badminton. I’ve had the privilege of leading teams to victories as the captain in both the University Hall Cricket Tournament and the Departmental Cricket Tournament. Additionally, I have a passion for mobile photography, where I capture candid moments and explore new perspectives. In my downtime, I enjoy watching talk shows on a range of global topics, which broadens my understanding and provides fresh inspiration.

These activities not only keep me grounded but also complement my academic and professional journey, helping me maintain balance and stay motivated.
