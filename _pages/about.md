Hello! My name is Md. Ariful Islam, and I have recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering from the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I graduated with a CGPA of 3.68/4.00 and ranked 9th in my class.

My research interests include machine learning, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), heat transfer, and optimization. During my undergraduate studies, I focused on optimizing the placement of offshore wind turbines using machine learning algorithms to account for wake effects. This research was funded by the Research and Innovation Center for Science and Technology (RISE) at BUET.

In addition to my thesis, I worked on data-driven ship design, where I utilized machine learning models to predict hydrostatic parameters and automated the process using MATLAB and Maxsurf. I am currently working on CFD simulations of cross-fin heat sinks using ANSYS Fluent to optimize heat transfer.

I have a strong foundation in thermal-fluid sciences from coursework in CFD, Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, Marine Hydrodynamics, and advanced mathematics, including Finite Element Methods, PDEs, and Fourier Analysis. My technical skills include proficiency in ANSYS Fluent, Rhinoceros, MATLAB, Python, C++, and Fortran.

Outside of my academic work, I am an avid sports enthusiast. I love playing cricket and badminton. I have had the honor of leading teams to victory as the captain in both the University Hall Cricket Tournament and the Departmental Cricket Tournament, where my leadership and teamwork skills were put to the test and truly shone.

When I'm not working on my research or playing sports, I enjoy exploring the world of mobile photography, capturing everything from everyday moments to unique, candid shots. I love experimenting with different perspectives and finding beauty in the simplest things around me.

In addition to photography, I am passionate about watching talk shows on various topics that span the globeâ€”from science and technology to culture and current events. These discussions inspire me to broaden my perspective and stay informed about the world around me.

Whether it's through photography or engaging in thoughtful discussions, these interests help me stay balanced and motivated, providing a creative outlet that complements my academic and professional pursuits.
