Hello! I’m Md. Ariful Islam, a graduate in Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering from the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I earned a CGPA of 3.68/4.00.

My research interests include machine learning, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), heat transfer, renewable energy, and optimization. For my thesis, funded by the Research and Innovation Center for Science and Technology (RISE), I optimized offshore wind turbine placement using machine learning. I’ve also worked on data-driven ship design, automating hydrostatic parameter predictions with MATLAB and Maxsurf, and I’m currently simulating cross-fin heat sinks using ANSYS Fluent.

I have a strong theoretical foundation in thermal-fluid sciences, with expertise in ANSYS Fluent, Abaqus CAE, Maxsurf, AutoCAD, Rhinoceros, MATLAB, Python, C++, and Fortran.

Outside of academics, I’m passionate about cricket and badminton, having captained teams to victory in both the University Hall Cricket Tournament and the Departmental Cricket Tournament. I also enjoy mobile photography, capturing candid moments, and experimenting with perspectives. In my free time, I watch talk shows on various global topics, which broaden my perspective and keep me inspired.

These hobbies help me stay balanced and motivated, complementing my academic and professional pursuits.
